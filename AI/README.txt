0. To use the AI, start the game and place the window on your leftmost monitor (which has the origin), on top of anything else.
1. Make sure that your background image or any program don't have a flat color of (20, 20, 60), or else the detection of the game's window position will fail.
2. Start the AI and wait for it to detect the game's window. If it detects the position, proceed to the next step, if not, check to see why it doesn't work.
3. Click on the game to be in focus and press SPACE to start the game and the AI at the same time.
4. Watch it go. DON'T move the mouse while in the game, because you may make the AI fail.

5. If you want to, press ESCAPE to stop the AI. Better de-focus the game to not stop the game with the AI.
6. The AI program prints some info at the end. See it.
