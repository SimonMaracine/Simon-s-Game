# Simon's Game and A.I.

Dana gave me the idea. **Challenge accepted**.  
Actually the original idea was only to clone this simple game. Later I got another idea: make an "A.I." for it. So I did.  
~~The A.I. is only for developers for now (it's not packaged in a binary), so you can only run it with Python and some
third party packages installed (you can see them in requirements.txt).~~ That was in the past. Now the A.I. is packaged too!  
Works of course on Windows and Linux.
