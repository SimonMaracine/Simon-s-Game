# Simon's Game and AI

Dana gave me the idea. **Challenge accepted**.  
Actually the original idea was only to clone this simple game. Later I got another idea: make an "AI" for it. So I did.  
The AI is only for developers for now (it's not packaged in a binary), so you can only run it with Python and some
third party packages installed (you can see them in requirements.txt).  
Works of course on Windows and Linux. Note that the AI may not work on Linux with Wayland.
